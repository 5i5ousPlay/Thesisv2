\section{Significance of the Study}


The significance of this study to the field of computer science is that it contributes to the topic of automated location approximation. The main contribution of this study is related to providing better algorithms for location approximation which is increasingly necessary for geospatial visualization. This study attempts to develop and test methods to produce a more fine-tuned process of the location approximation of tweets. In doing so, it will help future studies on location approximation by providing a point of reference to pick up from. 

The practical significance of this study to the Philippine society is that developing a more accurate way to quickly gather disaster related information will help increase situational awareness among citizens during times of disaster. This will potentially allow responders to obtain accurate information in a short amount of time, which will help them decide on the best course of action to take.
