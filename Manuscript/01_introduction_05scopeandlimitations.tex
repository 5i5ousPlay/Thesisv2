\section{Scope and Limitations of the Study}

This study uses mainly the Latent Semantic Analysis algorithm based off previous studies done as mentioned above \cite{ROSALES2017, VELASCOBERMEJODOMINGO2018}. This algorithm is implemented in Python using an extended Python library called Gensim. Algorithms like the Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and tools like the index similarity matrix will also be implemented using the same language and library. 

This study uses a dataset of tweets before and during Typhoon Yolanda collected via Twitter's Streaming API for testing and validation. Tweets containing keywords such as #EarthquakePH, #FloodPH, #WalangPasok, #ReliefPH, and #RescuePH in this time period are considered.
