\section{Research Objectives}
This study aims to test various methods of location approximation for non-geotagged tweets  to determine which approach produces the most accurate geolocation results. The intended results of this study are the following: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Derive different variations of Latent Semantic Analysis based methods (e.g. difference in datasets, changes in computing/analysis process)
    \item Test derived Latent Semantic Analysis based methods to compare which variation/s will produce better results relative to results from previous studies.
    \begin{enumerate}[-]
     \item Using different numbers of topics to train semantic models with
     \item Using other semantic models alongside the Latent Semantic Analysis model
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Visualize results of tested methods alongside original dataset values for comparison
\end{enumerate}
