\section{Research Questions}

 This study seeks to answer the question: What other methods may be explored and added to improve the performance of an existing Latent Semantic Analysis based geolocation algorithm? Furthermore, the following sub-questions are also intended to be answered:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How may a Latent Semantic Analysis based algorithm implemented in Python be improved or modified to produce more fine-tuned geolocation tags? 
    \subitem How may an LSA based geolocation approach be improved given results of previous LSA based methods involving convex hull weighted center/geometric center computations and region segmentation \cite{ROSALES2017, VELASCOBERMEJODOMINGO2018}?
    \item How will developed models from said implementation/s be visualized and be made available for use by external existing platforms?
    
\end{enumerate}
