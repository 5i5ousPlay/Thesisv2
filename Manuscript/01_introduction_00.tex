\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

The Philippines is considered as one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. One of the more common disasters that plague the archipelago is typhoons. It is estimated that an average of eight to nine typhoons occur in the area per year \cite{BR2013}.  On top of frequent storms and typhoons, factors such as poor housing and lack of proper response systems have led to heavy losses for the country's citizens \cite{BR2013, WH2014}.  

    Given how the country experiences frequent typhoons, it is important that disaster/typhoon
related information be easily accessible to everyone especially those in the disaster response field. Easy access to accurate and appropriate information will increase the ability of available responders to come up with the most suited type of response to a given scenario.
